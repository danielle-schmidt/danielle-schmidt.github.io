Danielle Schmidt-Larios is a PhD Candidate at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the joint departments of Sociology and Community and Environmental Sociology. She is broadly interested in rural and environmental sociology with ongoing research projects relating to transitions in land tenure, the well-being of agricultural workers, and rural livability. As a community-engaged mixed-methodologist, Schmidt-Larios incorporates ethnographic sensibilities and spatial thinking to investigate the concepts of place, land, and home. Her work has been published in journals such as Rural Sociology, Journal of Agriculture, Food Systems, and Community Development, and International Regional Science Review. 

Schmidt-Larios received her undergraduate degree in Philosophy and Public Policy from The University of Chicago, where her research on rural internet access won the Richard P. Taub award for best thesis. Beyond academia, she has varied experience in the public and nonprofit sectors through roles in program management, philanthropic consulting, and economic development. Danielle enjoys spending time outside and is an avid DIYâ€™er, community volunteer, and horseback rider. She resides in Madison, Wisconsin with her two- and four-legged family members: Leo, Chet, and Archie.
