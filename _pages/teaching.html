 <p style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">"The primary task of a useful teacher is to teach his [sic] students to recognize 'inconvenient' facts." Max Weber, 1918</p>

My approach to teaching emphasizes critical thinking by drawing on studentsâ€™ lived experiences to develop real-world skills. I believe effective higher education instruction should support students in troubling taken-for-granted truths and prepare them to take on challenges they may confront in any profession. I measure meaningful instruction by my ability to meet a broad range of student needs as they critically engage with new ways of thinking. To do this effectively, I prioritize student autonomy and focus on creating a classroom where students feel safe and encouraged to bring their whole selves.


I am interested in teaching courses at the undergraduate or graduate level on the following topics: 
Land and landownership//
Agrifood systems and/or agrarian studies//
Environmental sociology//
Rural people, places, and communities
Protected areas and conservation
Natural resource-based labor
Sense of place
Methods (qualitative, spatial, mixed, and/or case)

Assessments of my instruction are available upon request.
