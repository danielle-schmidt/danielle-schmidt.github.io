          "The primary task of a useful teacher is to teach his [sic] students
          to recognize 'inconvenient' facts." Max Weber, 1918

          My approach to teaching emphasizes critical thinking by drawing on
          studentsâ€™ lived experiences to develop real-world skills. I believe
          effective higher education instruction should support students in
          troubling taken-for-granted truths and prepare them to take on
          challenges they may confront in any profession. I measure meaningful
          instruction by my ability to meet a broad range of student needs as
          they critically engage with new ways of thinking. To do this
          effectively, I prioritize student autonomy and focus on creating a
          classroom where students feel safe and encouraged to bring their whole
          selves.
