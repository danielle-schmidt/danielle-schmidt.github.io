          Between 1950 and 2022, nearly a quarter of US agricultural land exited
          production, including 65 million acres over the course of a single
          generation (1992). This is alongside a parallel, but less
          well-documented, trend of extensive efforts to protect natural
          landscapes for conservation: approximately 69 million acres of land
          have entered environmental protection status since 1992.

          My dissertation project asks 1) what is the extent and nature of
          agricultural land transitioning to conservation, 2) how do
          agricultural land transitions change landscapes and the rural
          communities within them, and 3) what are the perceived implications of
          change in agricultural land use and tenure for the future of land
          stewardship in rural America?

          I explore these questions through a mixed-methods approach that
          connects cases across various geographic and temporal scales. After
          drawing on national remote sensing and administrative data to
          contextualize rural and agricultural land transitions over the last
          thirty years, I engage in field-based data collection in two
          locations: the Upper Missouri River Breaks of northeastern Montana and
          the Kickapoo Valley in the Wisconsin Driftless Area.

          The transition of US agricultural land to conservation reserves,
          forming in a moment of heightened concern for both food security and
          environmental protection, speaks to new land management priorities,
          shifts in socioeconomic relationships, and altered local place
          identities. If you are interested in learning more about my research,
          I invite you to get in touch.
