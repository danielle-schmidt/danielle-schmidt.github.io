              I am actively recruiting participants for this research study. If you have
              connections to either the Kickapoo Valley or Upper Missouri River Breaks and
              have personal or professional experience with agricultural land transitions,
              I welcome you to get in touch.
            </div>
           
          <p>
            Between 1950 and 2022, nearly a quarter of US agricultural land
            exited production, including 65 million acres over the course of a
            single generation (1992). This is alongside a parallel, but less
            well-documented, trend of extensive efforts to protect natural
            landscapes for conservation: approximately 69 million acres of land
            have entered environmental protection status since 1992.
          </p>
          <p>
            My dissertation project asks 1) what is the extent and nature of
            agricultural land transitioning to conservation, 2) how do
            agricultural land transitions change landscapes and the rural
            communities within them, and 3) what are the perceived implications
            of change in agricultural land use and tenure for the future of land
            stewardship in rural America?
          </p>
          <p>
            I explore these questions through a mixed-methods approach that
            connects cases across various geographic and temporal scales. After
            drawing on national remote sensing and administrative data to
            contextualize rural and agricultural land transitions over the last
            thirty years, I engage in field-based data collection in two
            locations: the Upper Missouri River Breaks of northeastern Montana
            and the Kickapoo Valley in the Wisconsin Driftless Area.
          </p>
          <p>
            The transition of US agricultural land to conservation reserves,
            forming in a moment of heightened concern for both food security and
            environmental protection, speaks to new land management priorities,
            shifts in socioeconomic relationships, and altered local place
            identities. If you are interested in learning more about my
            research, I invite you to get in touch.

          <h2>Changing Agricultural Landscapes</h2>
          <p>
            Places are dynamic. There are, however, moments of reckoning when
            places are fundamentally reshaped. Professor Katherine Curtis and I
            focus on one such community undergoing changing place identities in
            a long-term oral history project.
          </p>
          <p>
            South Phillips County, Montana is one of the most remote places in
            the contiguous United States. Changing land tenure patterns (driven
            by a number of global and local factors) have left a core group of
            landholders without clear succession plans for the first time in a
            century. We use ride-along oral histories as a primary method, but
            also survey, longitudinal parcel analysis, and more traditional
            interviewing methods to document the experiences and perspectives of
            current landholders.

          <h2>The Rural Livability Project</h2>
          <p>
            Rural places are often characterized by narratives of depopulation,
            disinvestment, and disengagement. While rural communities do face a
            number of challenges, not all rural communities are struggling. What
            can we learn from places that are doing “well”?
          </p>
          <p>
            The Rural Livability Project aims to better understand what makes a
            place somewhere people want to live. As an interdisciplinary team,
            we take novel, spatially-informed approaches to the study of what we
            call livability. My role on the team as a Research Assistant is to
            design and lead studies, engage in community outreach efforts, and
            participate in active collaboration with the rest of the team.
